Hi!

Congrats, and welcome to EP1 of this tutorial!

To get the default HTML skeleton:

1. Type the exclamation mark (!)
2. Press tab

How To Use:

Try to make index.html as much like the goal.html! Only index.html will run.
Try copy-pasting goal.html into index.html, and seeing what works, what dosen't work, everything.
index.html is like your scratchpad (pun intended). Do whatever you want with it!

Running your Code:

1. Open the Terminal if not open already (Press Ctrl/Command + J)
2. Paste this code: python3 -m http.server 8000
3. Open this in the browser: http://localhost:8000
4. If you want to stop it, go to the terminal and press Ctrl/Control + C
